# Tasks: Resource Automation & Live Counters

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-resource-automation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Unit tests are included as this is Phase 2+ development (per Constitution requirement). Tests validate specifications and catch regressions.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project structure (from plan.md):
- Source: `/home/greg/dev/ai-workshop/projects/cosmos-and-chaos-2025-11/src/`
- Tests: `/home/greg/dev/ai-workshop/projects/cosmos-and-chaos-2025-11/tests/`
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ modules, no build step

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 → US2 → US3 → US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1 (independently testable)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on US1/US2 (independently testable)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Parallel tasks ([P]) can run simultaneously within same phase
- Sequential tasks must complete in order
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: All 5 tasks can run in parallel (different object fields)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: Tests (T011, T012, T013) can run in parallel after core methods exist
- **Once Foundational completes**: All 4 user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- **Within US1**: T019, T020, T021 (tests) can run in parallel; T022, T030, T031 can run in parallel
- **Within US2**: T033, T034, T035 (tests) can run in parallel; T036, T037 can run in parallel
- **Within US3**: T046, T047, T048 (tests) can run in parallel; T049, T050, T052, T053 can run in parallel
- **Within US4**: T059, T060, T061 (tests) can run in parallel; T062, T063, T064 can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 Polish**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write unit test for updateCardProduction() in tests/production.test.js"
Task: "Write unit test for ProductionLoop.tick() in tests/production.test.js"
Task: "Write unit test for card production buffer flushing in tests/production.test.js"

# After core methods exist, launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task: "Create production.js module with updateCardProduction(cardId, deltaTime) function in src/js/production.js"
Task: "Add automated flag to card state initialization in src/js/state.js"
Task: "Implement startAutomation(cardId) method in src/js/state.js"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Write unit test for LED color thresholds (80%, 40%) in tests/efficiency.test.js"
Task: "Write unit test for base producer LED always green in tests/efficiency.test.js"
Task: "Write unit test for LED updates when efficiency changes in tests/display.test.js"

# Launch HTML and CSS tasks together:
Task: "Add status LED HTML element to card rendering in src/js/cards.js renderCard()"
Task: "Add status LED CSS styles (.status-led, .green, .yellow, .red) in src/css/cards.css"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T018) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T032)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - place Tier 1 card, verify auto-production
5. Deploy/demo if ready - you now have an idle game!

**MVP Deliverable**: Cards automatically produce resources - the core idle game mechanic works

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T018) → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T019-T032) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP! 🎯)
3. Add User Story 2 (T033-T045) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (visual feedback added)
4. Add User Story 3 (T046-T058) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (strategic depth added)
5. Add User Story 4 (T059-T071) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (economic complexity added)
6. Add Polish (T072-T086) → Final validation → Production release

**Each story adds value without breaking previous stories**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2) together (T001-T018)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T019-T032) - Core idle mechanic
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T033-T045) - Visual indicators
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T046-T058) - I/O indicators
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. All developers converge on User Story 4 (T059-T071) together (extends US1)
5. Team completes Polish (T072-T086) together

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 86
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 13 tasks (BLOCKS all stories)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Auto Production)**: 14 tasks (MVP!)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Status LEDs)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - I/O Indicators)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Multi Resources)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 15 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 38 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Place Tier 1 card → wait → observe counter increases automatically
- US2: Change resource availability → observe LED color changes (green/yellow/red)
- US3: Place adjacent cards with matching I/O → observe connection highlighting
- US4: Produce different resource types → verify separate tracking in global panel

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 (T001-T032, 32 tasks total)

**Estimated MVP Time**: 8-12 hours (per quickstart.md)

**Full Feature Time**: 20-30 hours (all 86 tasks)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests are REQUIRED per Constitution Principle VI (Testability & Maintainability)
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution requirement: Maintain 60 FPS with 25+ cards (validate with T081)
- Constitution requirement: Resource accuracy <1% (validate with T082)

---

**Tasks Status**: Ready for implementation
**Next Step**: Begin with Phase 1 (Setup) tasks T001-T005
**MVP Path**: Complete T001-T032 for working idle game mechanic
